    "\n",
    "PURPOSE: This programs takes \"Scores.txt\" file with a list of studnet test scores as input, evaluate letter grades and output a text file with the grades against all the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "INPUT: The \"Scores.txt\" file and the equations for converting the scores to letter grade are taken as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legend: ES = exam score; m = mean; s = standard deviation\n",

    "Grade Algorithm\n",

    "A: m + 1.5s ≤ ES\n",
    "B: m + .5s ≤ ES < m + 1.5s\n",
    "C: m - .5s ≤ ES < m + .5s\n",
    "D: m - 1.5s ≤ ES < m - .5s\n",
    "F: ES < m - 1.5s\n",
    "\n",
    "PROCESS: \n",
    "1.  Function to read scores from file\n",
    "2.  Function to calculate the mean of a list (in this case scores)\n",
    "3.  Function to calculate the standard deviation of a list\n",
    "4.  Function to calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, stdDeviation, count, max, and min\n",
    "5.  Function to calculate the letter grade for a given score based on cutoffs\n",
    "6.  Function to generate a list of letter grades for a list of scores\n",
    "7.  Function to count the distribution of letter grades\n",
    "8.  Function to write scores and letter grades to a file\n",
    "9.  Function to display the descriptive statistics and grade distribution\n",
    "10. Main function to control the program flow\n",
    "\n",
    "OUTPUT: Display the descriptive statistics of the scores from the text and grade distribution based on the letter grade calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue: It would have been much easier to use a statistical analysis library instead of writing different functions to do it. Though now we can use these functions as modules in our future programs.\n",
